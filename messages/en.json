    "howText": "Residents install sensors outside their windows that measure the level of air pollution. You can buy them inexpensively or build them yourself. All the sensors are connected in an open network and send data in real time. The more sensors installed in one area, the more accurately they can detect pollution levels.\n\nThe first step to change is to realize what you can't see with the naked eye: the air we breathe every day!",

    "item01text": " The main source is gas combustion and tobacco smoke. Also found in building and furniture materials such as chipboard. It is included in the list of carcinogenic substances, negatively affects the genetic material, reproductive organs, respiratory tract, eyes, and skin. It has a strong effect on the central nervous system.",
